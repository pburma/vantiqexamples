### Automate deployment using Vantiq Bootstrap file

This example uses the Vantiq bootstraping process to onboard edge nodes. The full documenation is listed here [Bootstrapping](http://localhost:8080/docs/system/config/index.html#bootstrapping). 

The process requires creating a Node template definition in the parent node which determines the default properties for the new node when it comes online including the connection to the cloud namespace. Once a node template is created a node configuraiton needs to be added which is used by the parent to make a connection to the child namespace. 

The steps to create and use the bootstrap file will look like this roughly.

* Parent: Create a Node definition of type Template.
* Parent: Create a Node configuration that uses the template you just created. 
* Parent: Right click on the node configuration and select Show Confiuration JSON. Save this to a bootstrap.json file. 
* Child: Mount the bootstrap.json file into the Vantiq config folder path eg; /opt/vantiq/config/bootstrap.json
* Child: Start the Vantiq server using the usual method, vantiq.sh or bringing up the docker image.

### Sample bootstrap.json file. Note this is auto-generated by Vantiq. 
```
{
   "name": "MyEdgeNode1",
   "nodeConfiguration": {
       "originatingUri": <uri used to connect to parent>
      "templateName": "EdgeTemplate",
      "nodeProperties": {
         "owner": "test1",
         "phone": "test1",
         "location": "test1"
      },
      "remoteUri": <uri used by parent to connect to child>,
      "credentialType": "token",
      "bootstrapToken": <access-token>
   }
}
```
